	abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate the new method of pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE), which can be used to extend the capabilities of multiple-color fluorescence imaging, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), and single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (spFRET) measurements. In PIE, multiple excitation sources are interleaved such that the fluorescence emission generated from one pulse is complete before the next excitation pulse arrives. Hence, the excitation source for each detected photon is known. Typical repetition rates used for PIE are between approximately 1 and 50 MHz. PIE has many applications in various fluorescence methods. Using PIE, dual-color measurements can be performed with a single detector. In fluorescence imaging with multicolor detection, spectral cross talk can be removed, improving the contrast of the image. Using PIE with FCCS, we can eliminate spectral cross talk, making the method sensitive to weaker interactions. FCCS measurements with complexes that undergo FRET can be analyzed quantitatively. Under specific conditions, the FRET efficiency can be determined directly from the amplitude of the measured correlation functions without any calibration factors. We also show the application of PIE to spFRET measurements, where complexes that have low FRET efficiency can be distinguished from those that do not have an active acceptor.},

The detectors have been arranged in a 12×4 square geometry with a pitch-to-diameter ratio of ten in order to minimize the collection of the light from non-conjugated excitation spots. In order to explore the trade-offs between the detectors' performance and the optical coupling with the experimental setup, SPADs with an active diameter of 25 and of 50µm have been manufactured. The use of a custom technology, specifically designed for the fabrication of the detectors, allowed us to combine a high photon detection efficiency (peak close to 50\% at a wavelength of 550nm) with a low dark count rate compatible with true single molecule detection. In order to allow easy integration into the optical setup for parallel single-molecule analysis, the SPAD array has been incorporated in a compact module containing all the electronics needed for a proper operation of the detectors.},

We find that the clamp predominantly is open in free RNAP and early intermediates in transcription initiation but closes upon formation of a catalytically competent transcription initiation complex and remains closed during initial transcription and transcription elongation. We show that four RNAP inhibitors interfere with clamp opening. We propose that clamp opening allows DNA to be loaded into and unwound in the RNAP active-center cleft, that DNA loading and unwinding trigger clamp closure, and that clamp closure accounts for the high stability of initiation complexes and the high stability and processivity of elongation complexes.},

We show further that putative alternative mechanisms for RNAP active-center translocation in initial transcription, involving "transient excursions" of RNAP relative to DNA or "inchworming" of RNAP relative to DNA, do not occur. The results support a model in which a stressed intermediate, with DNA-unwinding stress and DNA-compaction stress, is formed during initial transcription, and in which accumulated stress is used to drive breakage of interactions between RNAP and promoter DNA and between RNAP and initiation factors during promoter escape.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) at the single-molecule level currently provides qualitative information about distance, and quantitative information about kinetics of distance changes. Here, we used the sorting ability of confocal microscopy equipped with alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) to measure accurate FRET efficiencies and distances from single molecules, using corrections that account for cross-talk terms that contaminate the FRET-induced signal, and for differences in the detection efficiency and quantum yield of the probes. ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment. Using DNA fragments, we showed that ALEX-based distances agree well with predictions from a cylindrical model of DNA; ALEX-based distances fit better to theory than distances obtained at the ensemble level. Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography. ALEX can benefit structural analysis of biomolecules, especially when such molecules are inaccessible to conventional structural methods due to heterogeneity or transient nature.},

The results establish that a significant fraction, approximately 50\%-60\%, of mature elongation complexes retain sigma70 and that a determinant for sigma70 recognition in the initial transcribed region does not appreciably affect sigma70 retention in mature elongation complexes. The results further establish that, in mature elongation complexes that retain sigma70, the half-life of sigma70 retention is long relative to the time-scale of elongation, suggesting that some complexes may retain sigma70 throughout elongation.},

Freely diffusing molecules are sorted into subpopulations based on single-molecule signals detected within 100 micros to 1 ms. Distance distributions caused by fluctuations faster than 100 micros are studied within these subpopulations by using time-correlated single-photon counting. Measured distance distributions for dsDNA can be accounted for by considering fluorophore linkers and fluorophore rotational diffusion, except that we find smaller fluctuations for internally labeled dsDNA than DNA with one of the fluorophores positioned at a terminal site. We find that the electrostatic portion of the persistence length of short single-stranded poly(dT) varies approximately as the ionic strength (I) to the -1/2 power (I(-1/2)), and that the average contribution to the contour length per base is 0.40-0.45 nm. We study unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and unfolded acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) even under conditions where folded and unfolded subpopulations coexist (contributions from folded proteins are excluded by using alternating-laser excitation). At lower denaturant concentrations, unfolded CI2 and ACBP are more compact and display larger fluctuations than at higher denaturant concentrations where only unfolded proteins are present. The experimentally measured fluctuations are larger than the fluctuations predicted from a Gaussian chain model or a wormlike chain model. We propose that the larger fluctuations may indicate transient residual structure in the unfolded state.},

This was performed by labeling biomolecules with fluorophores that serve as donor-acceptor pairs for Förster resonance energy transfer, and by using alternating-laser excitation to excite directly both donors and acceptors present in single diffusing molecules. Emissions were reduced to the distance-dependent ratio E, and a distance-independent, stoichiometry-based ratio S. Histograms of E and S sorted species based on the conformation and association status of each species. S was sensitive to the stoichiometry and relative brightness of fluorophores in single molecules, observables that can monitor oligomerization and local-environment changes, respectively. FAMS permits equilibrium and kinetic analysis of macromolecule-ligand interactions; this was validated by measuring equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants for the interaction of Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein with DNA. FAMS is a general platform for ratiometric measurements that report on structure, dynamics, stoichiometries, environment, and interactions of diffusing or immobilized molecules, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Using a confocal epi-illuminated microscope together with a pulsed laser, new applications of the recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique BIFL (burst integrated fluorescence lifetime) are introduced. BIFL registers two different types of information on every detected photon with regard to the macroscopic time scale of a measurement and to the fluorescence lifetime. Thus, it is shown to be well suited to identify freely diffusing single dye molecules via their characteristic fluorescence lifetime. This allows for selective counting of dye molecules in an open volume element and opens up the possibility to quantify the relative concentration of the dye molecules, using a recently derived theoretical model, which analyzes the obtained burst size distribution of a sample survey. A closed theory is presented to calculate the probability of a specific dye to cause a fluorescence burst containing a certain number of detected photons. It considers the distribution of the excitation irradiance over the detection volume together with saturation effects of the fluorescence and of the detection electronics, the probability of different transit times through the detection volume, and the probability of multimolecule events. Using BIFL together with selective counting, the concentration of two dyes, Rhodamine B and Rhodamine 6G, in separate solutions and in a mixture were determined. The obtained results are consistent with the applied dye concentrations and with simultaneous measurements by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The introduced method is an appropriate tool for the complete characterization and quantitative analysis of a highly diluted sample in homogeneous assays.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) techniques are now widely used to address outstanding problems in biology and biophysics. In order to study freely diffusing molecules, current approaches consist in exciting a low concentration ({\textless}100 pM) sample with a single confocal spot using one or more lasers and detecting the induced single-molecule fluorescence in one or more spectrally- and/or polarization-distinct channels using single-pixel Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs). A large enough number of single-molecule bursts must be accumulated in order to compute FRET efficiencies with sufficient statistics. As a result, the minimum timescale of observable phenomena is set by the minimum acquisition time needed for accurate measurements, typically a few minutes or more, limiting this approach mostly to equilibrium studies. Increasing smFRET analysis throughput would allow studying dynamics with shorter timescales. We recently demonstrated a new multi-spot excitation approach, employing a novel multi-pixel SPAD array, using a simplified dual-view setup in which a single 8-pixel SPAD array was used to collect FRET data from 4 independent spots. In this work we extend our results to 8 spots and use two 8-SPAD arrays to collect donor and acceptor photons and demonstrate the capabilities of this system by studying a series of doubly labeled dsDNA samples with different donor-acceptor distances ranging from low to high FRET efficiencies. Our results show that it is possible to enhance the throughput of smFRET measurements in solution by almost one order of magnitude, opening the way for studies of single-molecule dynamics with fast timescale once larger SPAD arrays become available.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor) in the 3-10 nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores. While recent years have seen a growing number of contributions proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, rarely have those publications been accompanied by software implementation. In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete software package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date. In this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data. FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques, while providing an open, robust and well-documented implementation. Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison and development of new methods in burst analysis. We employ modern software engineering principles in order to minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability. Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution. Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes. Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs. By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among researchers in the single-molecule community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Single-molecule detection (SMD) technologies are well suited for clinical diagnostic applications by offering the prospect of minimizing precious patient sample requirements while maximizing clinical information content. Not yet available, however, is a universal SMD-based platform technology that permits multiplexed detection of both nucleic acid and protein targets and that is suitable for automation and integration into the clinical laboratory work flow.
METHODS: We have used a sensitive, specific, quantitative, and cost-effective homogeneous SMD method that has high single-well multiplexing potential and uses alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) fluorescence-aided molecule sorting extended to 4 colors (4c-ALEX). Recognition molecules are tagged with different-color fluorescence dyes, and coincident confocal detection of ≥2 colors constitutes a positive target-detection event. The virtual exclusion of the majority of sources of background noise eliminates washing steps. Sorting molecules with multidimensional probe stoichiometries (S) and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiencies (E) allows differentiation of numerous targets simultaneously.
RESULTS: We show detection, differentiation, and quantification—in a single well—of (a) 25 different fluorescently labeled DNAs; (b) 8 bacterial genetic markers, including 3 antibiotic drug–resistance determinants found in 11 septicemia-causing Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains; and (c) 6 tumor markers present in blood.
CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate assay utility for clinical molecular diagnostic applications by means of multiplexed detection of nucleic acids and proteins and suggest potential uses for early diagnosis of cancer and infectious and other diseases, as well as for personalized medicine. Future integration of additional technology components to minimize preanalytical sample manipulation while maximizing throughput should allow development of a user-friendly (“sample in, answer out”) point-of-care platform for next-generation medical diagnostic tests that offer considerable savings in costs and patient sample.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments can detect the distance between a donor and an acceptor fluorophore on the 3-10nm scale. In ratiometric smFRET experiments, the FRET efficiency is estimated from the ratio of acceptor and total signal (donor + acceptor). An excitation scheme involving two alternating lasers (ALEX) is often employed to discriminate between singly- and doubly-labeled populations thanks to a second ratiometric parameter, the stoichiometry S. Accurate FRET and S estimations requires applying three well-known correction factors: donor emission leakage into the acceptor channel, acceptor direct excitation by the donor excitation laser and the "gamma factor" (i.e. correction for the imbalance between donor and acceptor signals due to different fluorophore's quantum yields and photon detection efficiencies). Expressions to directly correct both raw FRET and S values have been reported in (Lee et al. BJ2005) in the context of freely-diffusing smFRET. Here we extend Lee et al. work providing several expressions for the direct excitation coefficient and highlighting a clear interpretation in terms of physical parameters and experimental quantities. Moreover, we derive a more complete set of analytic expressions for correcting FRET and S. We aim to provide a clear and concise reference for different definitions of correction coefficients and correction formulas valid for any smFRET experiment both in immobilized and freely-diffusing form.},

	abstract = {Heat shock triggers a transient and ubiquitous response, the function of which is to protect cells against stress-induced damage. The heat-shock response is controlled by a key transcription factor known as heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). We have developed a multiconfocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy setup to measure the dynamics of HSF1 during the course of the heat-shock response. The system combines a spatial light modulator, to address several points of interest, and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled camera for fast multiconfocal recording of the photon streams. Autocorrelation curves with a temporal resolution of 14 μs were analyzed before and after heat shock on eGFP and HSF1-eGFP-expressing cells. Evaluation of the dynamic parameters of a diffusion-and-binding model showed a slower HSF1 diffusion after heat shock. It is also observed that the dissociation rate decreases after heat shock, whereas the association rate is not affected. In addition, thanks to the multiconfocal fluorescence correlation spectroscopy system, up to five spots could be simultaneously located in each cell nucleus. This made it possible to quantify the intracellular variability of the diffusion constant of HSF1, which is higher than that of inert eGFP molecules and increases after heat shock. This finding is consistent with the fact that heat-shock response is associated with an increase of HSF1 interactions with DNA and cannot be explained even partially by heat-induced modifications of nuclear organization.},

We then take advantage of the higher throughput provided by parallel acquisition to address an outstanding question about the kinetics of the initial steps of bacterial RNA transcription. Our real-time kinetic analysis of promoter escape by bacterial RNA polymerase confirms results obtained by a more indirect route, shedding additional light on the initial steps of transcription.

The sensor, fabricated in a high-voltage CMOS process, has a resolution of 512 × 128 pixels and a pitch of 24 μm. The fill-factor of 5\% can be increased to 30\% with the use of microlenses. For precise control of the exposure and for time-resolved imaging, we use fast global gating signals to define exposure windows as small as 4 ns. The uniformity of the gate edges location is ∼140 ps (FWHM) over the whole array, while in-pixel digital counting enables frame rates as high as 156 kfps.Currently, our camera is used as a highly sensitive sensor with high temporal resolution, for applications ranging from fluorescence lifetime measurements to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and generation of true random numbers.},

	abstract = {We introduce three-color alternating-laser excitation (3c-ALEX), a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method that measures up to three intramolecular distances and complex interaction stoichiometries of single molecules in solution. This tool extends substantially the capabilities of two-color ALEX, which employs two alternating lasers to study molecular interactions (through probe stoichiometry S) and intramolecular distances (through FRET efficiency E), and sorts fluorescent molecules in multi-dimensional probe-stoichiometry and FRET-efficiency histograms. Probe-stoichiometry histograms allowed analytical sorting, identification, and selection of diffusing species; selected molecules were subsequently represented in FRET-efficiency histograms, generating up to three intramolecular distances. Using triply labeled DNAs, we established that 3c-ALEX enables 1), FRET-independent analysis of three-component interactions; 2), observation and sorting of singly, doubly, and triply labeled molecules simultaneously present in solution; 3), measurements of three intramolecular distances within single molecules from a single measurement; and 4), dissection of conformational heterogeneity with improved resolution compared to conventional single-molecule FRET. We also used 3c-ALEX to study large biomolecules such as RNA polymerase-DNA transcription complexes, and monitor the downstream translocation of RNA polymerase on DNA from two perspectives within the complex. This study paves the way for advanced single-molecule analysis of complex mixtures and biomolecular machinery.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) TRFS acquisition reported to date. The line sensor is an upgrade to our prior work and incorporates: i) parallelized interface from sensor to surrounding circuitry enabling high line rate to the PC (19,000 lines/s) and ii) novel time-gating architecture where detected photons in the OFF region are rejected digitally after the output stage of the SPAD. The time-gating architecture was chosen to avoid electrical transients on the SPAD high voltage supplies when gating is achieved by excess bias modulation. The time-gate has an adjustable location and time window width allowing the user to focus on time-events of interest. On-chip integrated center-of-mass (CMM) calculations provide efficient acquisition of photon arrivals and direct lifetime estimation of fluorescence decays. Furthermore, any of the SPC, TCSPC and on-chip CMM modes can be used in conjunction with the time-gating. The higher readout rate and versatile architecture greatly empower the user and will allow widespread applications across many techniques and disciplines. Here we focused on 3 examples of TRFS and time-gated Raman spectroscopy: i) kinetics of chlorophyll A fluorescence from an intact leaf; ii) kinetics of a thrombin biosensor FRET probe from quenched to fluorescence states; iii) ex vivo mouse lung tissue autofluorescence TRFS; iv) time-gated Raman spectroscopy of toluene at 3056 cm−1 peak. To the best of our knowledge, we detect spectrally for the first time the fast rise in fluorescence lifetime of chlorophyll A in a measurement over single fluorescent transient.},

	abstract = {With the evolving technology in CMOS integration, new classes of 2D-imaging detectors have recently become available. In particular, single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays allow detection of single photons at high acquisition rates (≥ 100kfps), which is about two orders of magnitude higher than with currently available cameras. Here we demonstrate the use of a SPAD array for imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (imFCS), a tool to create 2D maps of the dynamics of fluorescent molecules inside living cells. Time-dependent fluorescence fluctuations, due to fluorophores entering and leaving the observed pixels, are evaluated by means of autocorrelation analysis. The multi-τ correlation algorithm is an appropriate choice, as it does not rely on the full data set to be held in memory. Thus, this algorithm can be efficiently implemented in custom logic. We describe a new implementation for massively parallel multi-τ correlation hardware. Our current implementation can calculate 1024 correlation functions at a resolution of 10μs in real-time and therefore correlate real-time image streams from high speed single photon cameras with thousands of pixels.},

The strength of this hybrid approach is shown by an application to the flexible multidomain protein Hsp90. The average solution structure of Hsp90's closed state resembles the known X-ray crystal structure with Angstrom precision. The open state is represented by an ensemble of conformations with interdomain fluctuations of up to 25 Å. The data reveal a state-specific suppression of the submillisecond fluctuations by dynamic protein–protein interaction.

	abstract = {Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments probe molecular distances via distance dependent energy transfer from an excited donor dye to an acceptor dye. Single molecule experiments not only probe average distances, but also distance distributions or even fluctuations, and thus provide a powerful tool to study biomolecular structure and dynamics. However, the measured energy transfer efficiency depends not only on the distance between the dyes, but also on their mutual orientation, which is typically inaccessible to experiments. Thus, assumptions on the orientation distributions and averages are usually made, limiting the accuracy of the distance distributions extracted from FRET experiments. Here, we demonstrate that by combining single molecule FRET experiments with the mutual dye orientation statistics obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, improved estimates of distances and distributions are obtained. From the simulated time-dependent mutual orientations, FRET efficiencies are calculated and the full statistics of individual photon absorption, energy transfer, and photon emission events is obtained from subsequent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the FRET kinetics. All recorded emission events are collected to bursts from which efficiency distributions are calculated in close resemblance to the actual FRET experiment, taking shot noise fully into account. Using polyproline chains with attached Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 dyes as a test system, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by direct comparison to experimental data. We identified cis-isomers and different static local environments as sources of the experimentally observed heterogeneity. Reconstructions of distance distributions from experimental data at different levels of theory demonstrate how the respective underlying assumptions and approximations affect the obtained accuracy. Our results show that dye fluctuations obtained from MD simulations, combined with MC single photon kinetics, provide a versatile tool to improve the accuracy of distance distributions that can be extracted from measured single molecule FRET efficiencies.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive toolkit for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-restrained modeling of biomolecules and their complexes for quantitative applications in structural biology. A dramatic improvement in the precision of FRET-derived structures is achieved by explicitly considering spatial distributions of dye positions, which greatly reduces uncertainties due to flexible dye linkers. The precision and confidence levels of the models are calculated by rigorous error estimation. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by docking a DNA primer-template to HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The derived model agrees with the known X-ray structure with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.5 Å. Furthermore, we introduce FRET-guided 'screening' of a large structural ensemble created by molecular dynamics simulations. We used this hybrid approach to determine the formerly unknown configuration of the flexible single-strand template overhang.},

To overcome this problem, we developed a method that uses probabilistic data analysis to combine single-molecule measurements with X-ray crystallography data. The method determines not only the most likely position of a fluorescent dye molecule attached to the domain but also the complete three-dimensional probability distribution depicting the experimental uncertainty. With this approach, single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements can now be used as a quantitative tool for investigating the position and dynamics of flexible domains within macromolecular complexes. We applied this method to find the position of the 5' end of the nascent RNA exiting transcription elongation complexes of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) RNA polymerase II and studied the influence of transcription factor IIB on the position of the RNA.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (sm-FRET) has been recently applied to distance and position estimation in macromolecular complexes. Here, we generalize the previously published Nano-Positioning System (NPS), a probabilistic method to analyze data obtained in such experiments, which accounts for effects of restricted rotational freedom of fluorescent dyes, as well as for limited knowledge of the exact dye positions due to attachment via flexible linkers. In particular we show that global data analysis of complete FRET networks is beneficial and that the measurement of FRET anisotropies in addition to FRET efficiencies can be used to determine accurately both position and orientation of the dyes. This measurement scheme improves localization accuracy substantially, and we can show that the improvement is a consequence of the more precise information about the transition dipole moment orientation of the dyes obtained by FRET anisotropy measurements. We discuss also rigid body docking of different macromolecules by means of NPS, which can be used to study the structure of macromolecular complexes. Finally, we combine our approach with common FRET analysis methods to determine the number of states of a macromolecule.},

	abstract = {Photon bursts from single diffusing donor-acceptor labeled macromolecules were used to measure intramolecular distances and identify subpopulations of freely diffusing macromolecules in a heterogeneous ensemble. By using DNA as a rigid spacer, a series of constructs with varying intramolecular donor-acceptor spacings were used to measure the mean and distribution width of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies as a function of distance. The mean single-pair FRET efficiencies qualitatively follow the distance dependence predicted by Förster theory. Possible contributions to the widths of the FRET efficiency distributions are discussed, and potential applications in the study of biopolymer conformational dynamics are suggested. The ability to measure intramolecular (and intermolecular) distances for single molecules implies the ability to distinguish and monitor subpopulations of molecules in a mixture with different distances or conformational states. This is demonstrated by monitoring substrate and product subpopulations before and after a restriction endonuclease cleavage reaction. Distance measurements at single-molecule resolution also should facilitate the study of complex reactions such as biopolymer folding. To this end, the denaturation of a DNA hairpin was examined by using single-pair FRET.},
