	abstract = {We present a novel approach to high-throughput Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) which enables us to obtain one order of magnitude improvement in acquisition time. Our approach utilizes a liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulator to generate dynamically adjustable focal spots, and uses an eight-pixel monolithic single-photon avalanche photodiode array. We demonstrate the capabilities of this system by showing FCS of Rhodamine 6G under various viscosities, and by showing that, with proper calibration of each detection channel, one order of magnitude improvement in acquisition speed is obtained. More generally, our approach will allow higher throughput single-molecule studies to be performed.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy of freely diffusing molecules in solution is a powerful tool used to investigate the properties of individual molecules. Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are the detectors of choice for these applications. Recently a new type of SPAD detector was introduced, dubbed red-enhanced SPAD (RE-SPAD), with good sensitivity throughout the visible spectrum and with excellent timing performance. We report a characterization of this new detector for single-molecule fluorescence resonant energy transfer (smFRET) studies on freely diffusing molecules in a confocal geometry and alternating laser excitation (ALEX) scheme. We use a series of doubly-labeled DNA molecules with donor-to-acceptor distances covering the whole range of useful FRET values. Both intensity-based (ÎŒs-ALEX) and lifetime-based (ns-ALEX) measurements are presented and compared to identical measurements performed with standard thick SPADs. Our results demonstrate the great potential of this new detector for smFRET measurements and beyond.},

	abstract = {Using a confocal epi-illuminated microscope together with a pulsed laser, new applications of the recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique BIFL (burst integrated fluorescence lifetime) are introduced. BIFL registers two different types of information on every detected photon with regard to the macroscopic time scale of a measurement and to the fluorescence lifetime. Thus, it is shown to be well suited to identify freely diffusing single dye molecules via their characteristic fluorescence lifetime. This allows for selective counting of dye molecules in an open volume element and opens up the possibility to quantify the relative concentration of the dye molecules, using a recently derived theoretical model, which analyzes the obtained burst size distribution of a sample survey. A closed theory is presented to calculate the probability of a specific dye to cause a fluorescence burst containing a certain number of detected photons. It considers the distribution of the excitation irradiance over the detection volume together with saturation effects of the fluorescence and of the detection electronics, the probability of different transit times through the detection volume, and the probability of multimolecule events. Using BIFL together with selective counting, the concentration of two dyes, Rhodamine B and Rhodamine 6G, in separate solutions and in a mixture were determined. The obtained results are consistent with the applied dye concentrations and with simultaneous measurements by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The introduced method is an appropriate tool for the complete characterization and quantitative analysis of a highly diluted sample in homogeneous assays.},
