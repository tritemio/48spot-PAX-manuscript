	abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate the new method of pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE), which can be used to extend the capabilities of multiple-color fluorescence imaging, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS), and single-pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer (spFRET) measurements. In PIE, multiple excitation sources are interleaved such that the fluorescence emission generated from one pulse is complete before the next excitation pulse arrives. Hence, the excitation source for each detected photon is known. Typical repetition rates used for PIE are between approximately 1 and 50 MHz. PIE has many applications in various fluorescence methods. Using PIE, dual-color measurements can be performed with a single detector. In fluorescence imaging with multicolor detection, spectral cross talk can be removed, improving the contrast of the image. Using PIE with FCCS, we can eliminate spectral cross talk, making the method sensitive to weaker interactions. FCCS measurements with complexes that undergo FRET can be analyzed quantitatively. Under specific conditions, the FRET efficiency can be determined directly from the amplitude of the measured correlation functions without any calibration factors. We also show the application of PIE to spFRET measurements, where complexes that have low FRET efficiency can be distinguished from those that do not have an active acceptor.},

The detectors have been arranged in a 12×4 square geometry with a pitch-to-diameter ratio of ten in order to minimize the collection of the light from non-conjugated excitation spots. In order to explore the trade-offs between the detectors' performance and the optical coupling with the experimental setup, SPADs with an active diameter of 25 and of 50µm have been manufactured. The use of a custom technology, specifically designed for the fabrication of the detectors, allowed us to combine a high photon detection efficiency (peak close to 50\% at a wavelength of 550nm) with a low dark count rate compatible with true single molecule detection. In order to allow easy integration into the optical setup for parallel single-molecule analysis, the SPAD array has been incorporated in a compact module containing all the electronics needed for a proper operation of the detectors.},

Here, we used the sorting ability of confocal microscopy equipped with alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) to measure accurate FRET efficiencies and distances from single molecules, using corrections that account for cross-talk terms that contaminate the FRET-induced signal, and for differences in the detection efficiency and quantum yield of the probes. ALEX yields accurate FRET independent of instrumental factors, such as excitation intensity or detector alignment. Using DNA fragments, we showed that ALEX-based distances agree well with predictions from a cylindrical model of DNA; ALEX-based distances fit better to theory than distances obtained at the ensemble level. Distance measurements within transcription complexes agreed well with ensemble-FRET measurements, and with structural models based on ensemble-FRET and x-ray crystallography. ALEX can benefit structural analysis of biomolecules, especially when such molecules are inaccessible to conventional structural methods due to heterogeneity or transient nature.},

Freely diffusing molecules are sorted into subpopulations based on single-molecule signals detected within 100 micros to 1 ms. Distance distributions caused by fluctuations faster than 100 micros are studied within these subpopulations by using time-correlated single-photon counting. Measured distance distributions for dsDNA can be accounted for by considering fluorophore linkers and fluorophore rotational diffusion, except that we find smaller fluctuations for internally labeled dsDNA than DNA with one of the fluorophores positioned at a terminal site. We find that the electrostatic portion of the persistence length of short single-stranded poly(dT) varies approximately as the ionic strength (I) to the -1/2 power (I(-1/2)), and that the average contribution to the contour length per base is 0.40-0.45 nm. We study unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) and unfolded acyl-CoA binding protein (ACBP) even under conditions where folded and unfolded subpopulations coexist (contributions from folded proteins are excluded by using alternating-laser excitation). At lower denaturant concentrations, unfolded CI2 and ACBP are more compact and display larger fluctuations than at higher denaturant concentrations where only unfolded proteins are present. The experimentally measured fluctuations are larger than the fluctuations predicted from a Gaussian chain model or a wormlike chain model. We propose that the larger fluctuations may indicate transient residual structure in the unfolded state.},

	abstract = {We use alternating-laser excitation to achieve fluorescence-aided molecule sorting (FAMS) and enable simultaneous analysis of biomolecular structure and interactions at the level of single molecules. This was performed by labeling biomolecules with fluorophores that serve as donor-acceptor pairs for Förster resonance energy transfer, and by using alternating-laser excitation to excite directly both donors and acceptors present in single diffusing molecules. Emissions were reduced to the distance-dependent ratio E, and a distance-independent, stoichiometry-based ratio S. Histograms of E and S sorted species based on the conformation and association status of each species. S was sensitive to the stoichiometry and relative brightness of fluorophores in single molecules, observables that can monitor oligomerization and local-environment changes, respectively. FAMS permits equilibrium and kinetic analysis of macromolecule-ligand interactions; this was validated by measuring equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants for the interaction of Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein with DNA. FAMS is a general platform for ratiometric measurements that report on structure, dynamics, stoichiometries, environment, and interactions of diffusing or immobilized molecules, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Using a confocal epi-illuminated microscope together with a pulsed laser, new applications of the recently developed, real-time spectroscopic technique BIFL (burst integrated fluorescence lifetime) are introduced. BIFL registers two different types of information on every detected photon with regard to the macroscopic time scale of a measurement and to the fluorescence lifetime. Thus, it is shown to be well suited to identify freely diffusing single dye molecules via their characteristic fluorescence lifetime. This allows for selective counting of dye molecules in an open volume element and opens up the possibility to quantify the relative concentration of the dye molecules, using a recently derived theoretical model, which analyzes the obtained burst size distribution of a sample survey. A closed theory is presented to calculate the probability of a specific dye to cause a fluorescence burst containing a certain number of detected photons. It considers the distribution of the excitation irradiance over the detection volume together with saturation effects of the fluorescence and of the detection electronics, the probability of different transit times through the detection volume, and the probability of multimolecule events. Using BIFL together with selective counting, the concentration of two dyes, Rhodamine B and Rhodamine 6G, in separate solutions and in a mixture were determined. The obtained results are consistent with the applied dye concentrations and with simultaneous measurements by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The introduced method is an appropriate tool for the complete characterization and quantitative analysis of a highly diluted sample in homogeneous assays.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) allows probing intermolecular interactions and conformational changes in biomacromolecules, and represents an invaluable tool for studying cellular processes at the molecular scale. smFRET experiments can detect the distance between two fluorescent labels (donor and acceptor) in the 3-10 nm range. In the commonly employed confocal geometry, molecules are free to diffuse in solution. When a molecule traverses the excitation volume, it emits a burst of photons, which can be detected by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) detectors. The intensities of donor and acceptor fluorescence can then be related to the distance between the two fluorophores. While recent years have seen a growing number of contributions proposing improvements or new techniques in smFRET data analysis, rarely have those publications been accompanied by software implementation. In particular, despite the widespread application of smFRET, no complete software package for smFRET burst analysis is freely available to date. In this paper, we introduce FRETBursts, an open source software for analysis of freely-diffusing smFRET data. FRETBursts allows executing all the fundamental steps of smFRET bursts analysis using state-of-the-art as well as novel techniques, while providing an open, robust and well-documented implementation. Therefore, FRETBursts represents an ideal platform for comparison and development of new methods in burst analysis. We employ modern software engineering principles in order to minimize bugs and facilitate long-term maintainability. Furthermore, we place a strong focus on reproducibility by relying on Jupyter notebooks for FRETBursts execution. Notebooks are executable documents capturing all the steps of the analysis (including data files, input parameters, and results) and can be easily shared to replicate complete smFRET analyzes. Notebooks allow beginners to execute complex workflows and advanced users to customize the analysis for their own needs. By bundling analysis description, code and results in a single document, FRETBursts allows to seamless share analysis workflows and results, encourages reproducibility and facilitates collaboration among researchers in the single-molecule community.},

	abstract = {Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments can detect the distance between a donor and an acceptor fluorophore on the 3-10nm scale. In ratiometric smFRET experiments, the FRET efficiency is estimated from the ratio of acceptor and total signal (donor + acceptor). An excitation scheme involving two alternating lasers (ALEX) is often employed to discriminate between singly- and doubly-labeled populations thanks to a second ratiometric parameter, the stoichiometry S. Accurate FRET and S estimations requires applying three well-known correction factors: donor emission leakage into the acceptor channel, acceptor direct excitation by the donor excitation laser and the "gamma factor" (i.e. correction for the imbalance between donor and acceptor signals due to different fluorophore's quantum yields and photon detection efficiencies). Expressions to directly correct both raw FRET and S values have been reported in (Lee et al. BJ2005) in the context of freely-diffusing smFRET. Here we extend Lee et al. work providing several expressions for the direct excitation coefficient and highlighting a clear interpretation in terms of physical parameters and experimental quantities. Moreover, we derive a more complete set of analytic expressions for correcting FRET and S. We aim to provide a clear and concise reference for different definitions of correction coefficients and correction formulas valid for any smFRET experiment both in immobilized and freely-diffusing form.},

	abstract = {We describe an 8-spot confocal setup for high-throughput smFRET assays and illustrate its performance with two characteristic experiments. First, measurements on a series of freely diffusing doubly-labeled dsDNA samples allow us to demonstrate that data acquired in multiple spots in parallel can be properly corrected and result in measured sample characteristics consistent with those obtained with a standard single-spot setup. We then take advantage of the higher throughput provided by parallel acquisition to address an outstanding question about the kinetics of the initial steps of bacterial RNA transcription. Our real-time kinetic analysis of promoter escape by bacterial RNA polymerase confirms results obtained by a more indirect route, shedding additional light on the initial steps of transcription. Finally, we discuss the advantages of our multispot setup, while pointing potential limitations of the current single laser excitation design, as well as analysis challenges and their solutions.},

	abstract = {Alternating-laser excitation (ALEX) spectroscopy has recently been added to the single-molecule spectroscopy toolkit. ALEX monitors interaction and stoichiometry of biomolecules, reports on biomolecular structure by measuring accurate Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies, and allows sorting of subpopulations on the basis of stoichiometry and FRET. Here, we demonstrate that a simple combination of one continuous-wave donor-excitation laser and one directly modulated acceptor-excitation laser (Periodic Acceptor eXcitation) is sufficient to recapitulate the capabilities of ALEX while minimizing the cost and complexity associated with use of modulation techniques.},

	abstract = {We introduce Photon-HDF5, an open and efficient file format to simplify exchange and long-term accessibility of data from single-molecule fluorescence experiments based on photon-counting detectors such as single-photon avalanche diode, photomultiplier tube, or arrays of such detectors. The format is based on HDF5, a widely used platform- and language-independent hierarchical file format for which user-friendly viewers are available. Photon-HDF5 can store raw photon data (timestamp, channel number, etc.) from any acquisition hardware, but also setup and sample description, information on provenance, authorship and other metadata, and is flexible enough to include any kind of custom data. The format specifications are hosted on a public website, which is open to contributions by the biophysics community. As an initial resource, the website provides code examples to read Photon-HDF5 files in several programming languages and a reference Python library (phconvert), to create new Photon-HDF5 files and convert several existing file formats into Photon-HDF5. To encourage adoption by the academic and commercial communities, all software is released under the MIT open source license.},
